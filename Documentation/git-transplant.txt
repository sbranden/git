NAME
----
git-transplant - Transplant commits from current branch to another

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git transplant' [<options>] <revision range> <destination branch>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Transplant a range of commits from the current branch onto or into
another, removing them from the original branch, which will remain
checked out upon completion.  The commits can optionally be inserted
inside the destination branch, i.e. not at its tip, using the
`--after` option.

The revision range is specified in the standard format accepted by
`git rev-parse`, e.g.

    A..B
    A...B
    A^!   (just commit A)

Obviously this command rewrites history!  As with
linkgit:git-rebase[1], you should be aware of all the implications of
history rewriting before using it.  In particular, if the range does
not include the tip of the source branch, there is a risk of conflicts
once the remainder of the source branch is rebased with the commits
removed.

This command is actually just a glorified wrapper around
linkgit:git-splice[1].

OPTIONS
-------

-a <commit>::
--after=<commit>::
	Transplant into inside the destination branch after the given
	commit.

-n <commit>::
--new-from=<commit>::
	First create the destination branch starting at the given
	commit.

--abort::
	Abort an in-progress transplant.

--continue::
	Resume an in-progress transplant.

--in-progress:
	Exit 0 if and only if a splice is in progress.

EXAMPLES
--------
`git transplant A..B X`::

	Move commits A..B from the current branch onto branch X.

`git transplant --after=C A..B X`::

	Move commits A..B from the current branch into branch X
	after commit C.

`git transplant --new-from=Y A..B X`::

	Create a new branch X starting at ref Y, then
	move commits A..B from the current branch onto X.

`git transplant --abort`::

	Abort a transplant which failed during cherry-pick or rebase

`git transplant --continue`::

	Resume a transplant after manually fixing conflicts caused by
	cherry-pick or rebase.

`git transplant --in-progress && git transplant --abort`::

	Abort if there is a transplant in progress.
